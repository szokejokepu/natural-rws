In this folder you will find PB files of pre-trained models, such as imagenet.
The PB files will be automatically generated by running the corresponding scripts.

The pbtxt.py script generates the graph of imagenet in inception_v4.pbtxt(default name). 
The freeze_graph downloads the inception_v4 checkpoint which is taken as input along with the output of pbtxt.py to generate the pb file.
To recap

# to create inception_v4.pb

python pbtxt.py

python freeze_graph.py inception_v4.pbtxt --output_node_names=InceptionV4/Logits/AvgPool_1a/AvgPool


This works only for the inception_v4 model.

To calculate the Frechet Inception Distance, the frozen inception graph generated should have output node as InceptionV4/Logits/AvgPool_1a/AvgPool
To calculate the Inception Score, the frozen inception graph generated should have output node as InceptionV4/Logits/Logits/BiasAdd
